# ToDoList
CUSTOMIZATION:

1. Update the format and CSS so that the color pallete is closer to Wunderlist.
2. Create a theme toggler with CSS written to options that mimic Wunderlist, Google ToDos, Microsoft ToDos, and Trello.
3. Create an object/ array of compliments and encouragements (a little like a fortune cookie), and then write/ add a function to randomly select and pull in one "fortune" for every ToDo added, so that if I add "Buy Milk," I get a ToDo list item that says buy milk, and a second immediately afterward that says "go hug a puppy" "remember 4 things for which you are grateful today" or "Close your eyes and focus on your breathing for 1 minute."

Refining:
4. Create a master array/object of Fortunes
5. Create a Current List
6. Provide an input for creating custom fortunes
7. Allow people to star a fortune as a class "liked" or "unliked"
8. Settings allow people to choose only favorites/ all fortunes/ etc.
